Let site users subscribe to categories or tags . Send post updates automatically.
== Description ==
This plugin helps you tailor your notifications and alerts to the users interests.
Automatically send a **new post notification or email digest** to all users subscribed to one of its categories, tags, or authors.
For each post published, you might not want to send an email to your entire email list. 
This plugin will help you segment subscribers to send targeted emails.
Send an email grouping together the latest blog posts relevant to users preferences.
Store locally and send with the provider of your choice, or store and send with mailchimp.

**Grow your mailing list and collect subscribers interests :** Insert a subscription and category/tag selection form anywhere on your website.
**Send highly relevant emails automatically :** Notify users when a result for one of their searches, or a post under a category or they've marked as relevant to their interests, has been added.
**Decide how often you want to send an email digest of published posts :** Email frequency matters. You can group together a few blog posts to send at your desired frequency.
